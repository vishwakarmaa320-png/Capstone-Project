### âž¢ Given three datasets (Employee, Project, and Designation) with missing values, inconsistent data, and relational dependencies. The objective was to clean, transform, and analyze data to evaluate employee and project performance.
### âž¢ Perform real-world data wrangling and analysis tasks such as handling missing values, splitting and merging columns, applying conditions, calculating aggregates, and exporting clean results.
### âž¢ Cleaned missing values in the dataset by applying running average techniques using loops. Split employee names into â€˜First Nameâ€™ and â€˜Last Nameâ€™, and dropped redundant columns. Merged all three datasets into a consolidated dataframe for further analysis. Created calculated fields such as bonus allocation (5% for successful projects).
### âž¢ Delivered a fully cleaned and structured dataset (final) with enriched features such as employee designation updates, project costs, and bonuses. The project demonstrated end-to-end data preprocessing and analysis, strengthening practical skills in Python, Pandas, and real-world data handling.
